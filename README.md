Cadet Chronicles: March to the Arch
The purpose of our project was to emulate the timeless gameplay of Super Mario Bros in a
modern, Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) inspired manner. We sought to add unique
features that would appeal to RMC cadets who have experienced the challenges of being a cadet
that we integrated throughout the game. The level design was inspired by the 4 pillars of RMC
with each level requiring the players to collect certain items related to the academic, bilingualism,
fitness, and military pillars.
